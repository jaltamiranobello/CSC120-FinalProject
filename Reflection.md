Reflection
- This game taught us so much about the impact that user interaction has on game making. In our old python game, user interaction wasnt a huge priority since it was only a multiple choice game that didnt require us to think about the possible paths a user can take; it was very black and white. On the other hand, this project is more complex since we have to think about every possible action a user might want to utilize inside an escape room.
