This file will contain documentation for all commands available in your game.

Note:  It's a good idea to also make this list available inside the game, in response to a `HELP` command.


# SPOILER ALERT
documenting all of the available commands, as well as a **description of the layout** of your game world's underlying physical layout; this can be described in words, or included as a separate image file if you prefer to sketch a map by hand.  If your game includes **challenges** that must be overcome to win, also describe them here.
If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

## GAME LAYOUT

    First, the character starts in the bedroom of an ominous house. Then after exploring the room, retrieving letters that contain bits and pieces of a code and possibly pick up items in the furniture, the character can then move onto the next set of rooms if they enter in the code correctly. The next set of rooms are toyrooms; however, there are easy, medium, and hard versions of this room based on how many items the character collected in the previous room. It then goes onto three versions of a kitchen and then a bathroom and finally the last room the character goes to is a living room which there is only one version of. In the living room, the character is then judged based on how many total items they have collected in all the previous rooms and is either taught the truth about the game (which is that is a purgatory and you are there to relive and repent for things that happened to them before they died) or to involuntarily have to be stuck in the loop of the game until they can learn the truth!
