# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`

## Reflection
This game taught us so much about the impact that user interaction has on game making. In our old python game, user interaction wasnt a huge priority since it was only a multiple choice game that didnt require us to think about the possible paths a user can take; it was very black and white. On the other hand, this project is more complex since we have to think about every possible action a user might want to utilize inside an escape room. And we also have to think about how the titles of our action methods impact the game play. We got more experience dealing with classes that interact with one another. 

 ## Design Justification

  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
    - thinking about how classes interact with eachother, trying to visualize how a video game character would move within our game, and trying to think about the user experience 
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
    - how to make seemingly unrealted classes interact with eachoter
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
    - I wish we had more time to venture out and experiment with sound 
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
    - graphics and sound
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
    - girl in class who played the game on demo day made us aware of the issue with holding a letter
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
    -  I'd say dont stress and keep it simple
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
    - our group is a true team, we work very well together and always have great communication
